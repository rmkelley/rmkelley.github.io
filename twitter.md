## Introduction

Over the past several years, big data has taken the world by storm. Whether it is

### Data and code

An important note about twitter data is that users are more likely to be technologically competant, younger, and able to afford a mobile or web connected device. When thinking about who is in the most danger from extreme events or other disasters, it is not people who have the means or capacity to act for themselves who are at risk.

### Conclution

What is facinating about this lab is that anyone with the technelogical know-how could have developed this problem and executed it. All of the data was available, and as far as open source software goes, RStudio and QGIS are relativly accessable. This brings up the question of what can research look like in this modern age of big data? 

Each individual in this class found and contributed an article to a literature on twitter-based research, and a large proportion of the articles sourced were inductive- i.e. they took data, began working with it, and then figured out what stuck. Twitter has a history of inspiring and enabling such research because of the sheer amount of data available to researchers. From social networks to geographic location to likes to the actual body of the tweet itself and beyond, there is so much data within just a single tweet. Twitter is of course more than a research tool, however. It is only useful for academics because people in society take to the platform to express themselves, share information, have conversations, and more. It is a freeflowing conversation. Elwood et al. (2012) describe how voulnteered geographic information is changing the academic field of geography and beyond. VGI is not limited to tweets, but can be anything from a geotagged photo to a forum like OpenStreetMap.

Oh- and it is also good to know that a statistically significant amount of people in the places that Trump lied about being in danger were not stupid or blind enough to belive him. This time, at least.
