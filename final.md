### GIS, statistics, and R- cross platform replicability and transparency

I am interested in exploring how to do many of the actions/topics covered this semester in R. This might include spatial analysis, database management, basic mapping, probability functions, and maybe more. In class we have already begun exploring how to add files to a database using R, but I am still interested in finding ways to push the limit of that knowledge. Related topics that we have covered in class include replicability (how switching software affects the possibility of reenacting work) and how to manage variability in data/representation. One of the greatest possible strengths of R is the capacity to write out the code for an entire problem and then run it, either in pieces or in its entirety. I am interested to see how much it would be reasonable to do in one workflow in R which draws on how we began to use SQL in our work.

Academic resources I might use include:

The chapter on Error evaluation and tracking

Accounting for Spatial Uncertainty in Optimization with Spatial Decision Support Systems

Social vulnerability indices A comparative assessment using uncertainty and sensitivity analysis

Uncertainty Analysis for a Social Vulnerability Index

The main thrust of what I am interested in doing is replicating some of the prcesses that we have done in a different software format.
