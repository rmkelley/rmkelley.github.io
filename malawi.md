# Reprodicability in Geographic Research; an academic analysis
## Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa: An operationalized approach in Malawi
### By Malcomb, Weaver, and Krakowka, 2014

The goal of this lab project was to replicate the work done by Malcomb et al. for their vulnerability assessment of Malawi. This process began with a close reading of the article to determine their data sources, workflow, and the exact nature of their results. In brief, it was impossible for us to completely achieve any of those objectives. Datafiles came from several sources: FEWS Net (providing the geographic boundaries), the UNEP GRID Global Risk Data Platform for the flood and drought vulnerability rasters (40% of the vulnerability model below), and the DHS for community features and vulnerabilities (40% of the vulnerability model below). Professor Holler was unable to locate the remaining 20% of data inputs for the model, meaning that there was no possibility of true reproducibility even were the other aspects of the lab faithfully reproduced.
