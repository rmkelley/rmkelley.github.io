# Reprodicability in Geographic Research; an academic analysis
## Vulnerability modeling for sub-Saharan Africa: An operationalized approach in Malawi
### By Malcomb, Weaver, and Krakowka, 2014

The goal of this lab project was to replicate the work done by Malcomb et al. for their vulnerability assessment of Malawi. This process began with a close reading of the article to determine their data sources, workflow, and the exact nature of their results. In brief, it was impossible for us to completely achieve any of those objectives. Datafiles came from several sources: FEWS Net showing livelihood sensitivity(20% of the vulnurability model below), the UNEP GRID Global Risk Data Platform for the flood and drought vulnerability rasters (40% of the model), and the DHS for community features and vulnerabilities (40% of the model). Professor Holler was unable to track down the FEWS Net dataset, meaning that there was no possibility of true reproducibility even if the other aspects of the lab were faithfully reproduced.

These two maps of resiliancy are from 2004 and 2010 respectivly, but notice that there are different numbers of traditional authorities between the two maps.

Malcomb et al. weighed indicators on a 0-5 scale

The drought and flood data came in different sized raster resolutions (0.04166666 vs 0.08333333 decimal degrees), meaning that one of the two datasets had to be converted to
