## First and Second Labs: QGIS Modelling

Open source software has never been a more accessable and powerfull alternative to proprietary software. Statistical programs such as R have been mainstreamed and for spatial software, QGIS has an active and growing community of developers and users.

This is a version of my model that uses some SQL code.

[SQL model version](SQL_Az_Model.model3)

Here is a link to the page containing the non-SQL version of the model
