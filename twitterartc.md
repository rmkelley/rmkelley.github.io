review:
purpose, hypothesis, or question: is it deductive or inductive?
source of twitter data, including query parameters if known
is the research reproducible? (can you get the same data and produce the same results)
is the research replicable (can you apply it to a new case  and get similar findings/conclusions)?
do the packages/libraries  exist in R to accomplish the research? Search R + Library + keywords of techniques needed

While the website claimed that "All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files," that was only partilly true. There were some datafiles included on the page, but there was no link to the entire database of tweets or even a breakdown of information for each tweet.
